# Brid Player

***

A set of utilities to create a bridge between Real Debrid (as well as others eventually) and a media library in a
portable manner. I want to be able to search, verify cache status, and add to library, as well
as play, create playlists, and more. I haven't used anything Windows specific, however I am not sure how far this will go on linux.

I want to also incorporate a couple of plex and rclone features, or at least a couple tools to work with them.
